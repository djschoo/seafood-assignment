# seafood-assignment

This project provides a brief analysis of a fictional dataset of a region's seafood industry economic output in recent years. Part of the data analysis was done in Excel and is not shown; the remaining part was done in Python (Pandas) and the Jupyter notebook is included. The final report takes the form of an information briefing note.
